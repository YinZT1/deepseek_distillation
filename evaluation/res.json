The distance traveled in each segment of the path is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs of length 1, which is \\(\\sqrt{2}\\).\n\nTo find out how many segments the point travels, we divide the total distance by the length of each segment:\n\\[ \\frac{30\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{2}} = 30. \\]\nThis means the point travels 30 segments, or 30 units in both the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) directions in the unfolded plane.\n\nNow, we need to determine the coordinates of the point after traveling 30 units in both directions. Since the side length of the original triangle is 1, the point will have traveled 30 units in the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) directions in the unfolded plane, which corresponds to 30 steps of 1 unit each in the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) directions. However, we need to find the equivalent position within one unit triangle.\n\nSince the point travels 30 units in both directions, we can reduce these coordinates modulo 1 (the side length of the triangle):\n\\[ x = 30 \\mod 1 = 0, \\]\n\\[ y = 30 \\mod \\sqrt{3} = 0. \\]\nThis means the point returns to the origin after traveling 30 segments.\n\nTherefore, the distance from the origin after the point has traveled a cumulative distance of \\(30\\sqrt{2}\\) is:\n\\[ \\boxed{0}. \\] </s>\n<details>\n<summary>Explanation of the reduction modulo 1 and \\(\\sqrt{3}\\):</summary>\n\nWhen the point travels 30 units in the \\(x\\) direction, it effectively wraps around the triangle 30 times horizontally, ending up at the same horizontal position as the starting point, which is \\(x = 0\\). Similarly, when the point travels 30 units in the \\(y\\) direction, it wraps around the triangle vertically, but since the height of the triangle is \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\), we need to consider the vertical wrapping. The point travels 30 units vertically, and since the height of the triangle is \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\), the point wraps around \\(\\frac{30}{\\sqrt{3}/2} = 20\\sqrt{3}\\) times, which is an integer multiple of the height, so it also ends up at the same vertical position as the starting point, which is \\(y = 0\\).\n\nThus, the point returns to the origin after traveling 30 segments, and the distance from the origin is \\(\\boxed{0}\\).\n</details> </details>\n```python\n# The solution involves understanding the periodicity of the point's movement within the triangle.\n# After traveling 30 segments, the point returns to the origin because the side length of the triangle is 1.\n# Therefore, the distance from the origin is 0.\n\ndistance_from_origin = 0\nprint(distance_from_origin)\n```\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{0}\\). </s>\nTo solve the problem of determining the distance of a point from the origin after it has traveled a cumulative distance of \\(30\\sqrt{2}\\) inside a unit equilateral triangle, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Geometry and Unfolding Method**:\n   - The point starts at \\((0,0)\\) and moves in the direction of \\((1,1)\\), which means it travels along the line \\(y = x\\).\n   - Each time the point hits a side of the triangle, it reflects off the side such that the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection.
